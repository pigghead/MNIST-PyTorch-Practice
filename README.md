# What is MNIST?
The MNIST database is a large database of handwritten digits that is commonly used for training various image processing systems.

# About This Project
This project utilizes the PyTorch framework to analyze the MNIST data and train a model to predict what hand drawn number it is shown. As this is my first attempt at Machine Learning,
there is still much that I have to go over and learn about these concepts. But this is my first (somewhat) successful implementation of ML!
